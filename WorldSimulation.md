# World Simulation Engine

A framework for simulating virtual worlds and intelligent mutating agents. 

## Motivation

The ultimate goal of Marumugam foundation is to gather people interested in Artificial Intelligence to work together to contribute to the development of strong AI or Artificial General Intelligence, AGI. We have quite a few project proposals and a few prototypes based in narrow AI : [OCR with Deep Convolutional Neural Network, Machine Translation and Cognition](https://github.com/marumugam/deeptamil). Some of the project proposals are [Document Summarization](https://github.com/marumugam/eb), Audio book generation from text documents, Conversational Model of Browsing and Mind Uploading.

> As you can see, so far we have not confronted the problem of AGI directly. "Introducing Intelligence into Applications" has been our motto so far. At least based on our footprints. 

World Simulation Engine is our first attempt to orient our practices with our original goals. WSE will come under a sister organization of Marumugam as their goals have turned out to be considerably different. All the experiments focussed on AGI will come under the umbrella of this sub-organization.

## Details

WSE is a world simulation framework similar to but not as complex as OpenCog. The primary goal of WSE is to simulate a restricted world with constantly mutating intelligent agents and provide access to the user for interacting with the virtual environment and the agents, by including the user as an agent.
